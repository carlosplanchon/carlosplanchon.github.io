**This post was written using DeepSeek-R1 AI. The tool is seems to be surprisingly precise for writing!**

**This post highlights three weekend projects‚Äîsmall tools built to solve real problems.**¬†No Kubernetes, no boilerplate, no grand missions. Just focused code for niche workflows: managing task quotas, simplifying AI integrations, and analyzing market data. Built with modern tools (FastAPI, Python, lightweight JS) but designed to stay simple. Think of these as blueprints, not polished products. Let‚Äôs dive in.

### **1\. NanoSaaS: A Microservice Platform for Task Control:**

**What it does**: A lightweight system to manage computational tasks with a credits system.

**Key features**:

\- **Credits system**: Users get a number of credits to run tasks, preventing resource abuse, and allowing you to sell your software as a service.

\- **Real-time monitoring**: Track task progress live without refreshing the page.

\- **Google SSO**: Secure login without managing passwords.

\- **Stack**: FastAPI (backend), Celery (task queue), Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS (frontend).

**Why it matters**: Perfect for small teams or solo developers who need to track jobs without overcomplicating things. No Kubernetes, no bloat‚Äîjust tasks and quotas.

### **2\. FastAPI AI Assistant: A Chatbot That Leverage OpenAI Assistants API:**

**What it does**: A minimalist FastAPI app that wraps OpenAI‚Äôs Code Interpreter into a real-time chatbot.

**Key features**:

\- **Streaming responses**: Answers appear word-by-word via Server-Sent Events (SSE), no waiting for full completion.

\- **Simple integration**: FastAPI acts as a clean middleware layer between OpenAI and the frontend.

\- **Stack**: FastAPI (backend), Alpine.js (frontend), Tailwind CSS (styling).

**Why it matters**: Need a no-fuss way to test OpenAI‚Äôs Assistants API? This is a template for adding conversational AI to apps without drowning in boilerplate.

### **3\. MeasureVolume: Gauging Market Taker Activity:**

**What it does**: Analyzes order book snapshots (like those from crypto exchanges) to estimate trading volume and liquidity changes.

**Key features**:

\- **Order book diffing**: Compares consecutive snapshots to infer executed trades.

\- **Sample datasets**: Includes toy data to experiment with.

\- **Scripts**: A script to gauge market takers activity.

**Why it matters**: For traders or researchers, this offers a lightweight way to study market dynamics without proprietary tools.
